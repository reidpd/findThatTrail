# findThatTrail
An app that pins trailhead locations to a map via a trailAPI, along with other features.

Thanks for visiting my first project's repo! It is a humble little app, and we're happy it has made your acquaintance!

Visit https://find-that-trail.herokuapp.com/html/index.html to find trailheads near and far to plan for your next journey. Enjoy!
